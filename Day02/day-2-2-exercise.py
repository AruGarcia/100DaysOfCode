# Instructions

# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
#
# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall
# person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.


# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

convert_height = float(height)
convert_weight = float(weight)

BMI = convert_weight / convert_height**2

print(f'{BMI:.0f}')
