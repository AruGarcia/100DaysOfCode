# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year.
# A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.
# The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it more justice:

#
# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
#
#     on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
#
#     **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100
#
#     **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# First *fork* your copy. Then copy-paste your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# Finally click "Run" to execute the tests

if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 != 0:
        print('Leap year')
    else:
        if year % 400 == 0:
            print('Leap year')
        else:
            print('Not Leap year')
else:
    print('Not leap year.')
