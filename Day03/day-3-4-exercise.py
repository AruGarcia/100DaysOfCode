# Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza. Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program.
#
# Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.
#
# Small Pizza: $15
#
# Medium Pizza: $20
#
# Large Pizza: $25
#
# Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2
#
# Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3
#
# Extra cheese for any size pizza: + $1

print("Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries!")
size = input("What size pizza do you want? S, M, or L ")
add_pepperoni = input("Do you want pepperoni? Y or N ")
extra_cheese = input("Do you want extra cheese? Y or N ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

price = 0
if size == "S":
    price = 15
elif size == "M":
    price = 20
else:
    price = 25
if size == "S":
    if add_pepperoni == "Y":
        price += 2
else:
    if add_pepperoni == "Y":
        price += 3
if extra_cheese == "Y":
    price += 1
    print(f'Your final bill is: ${price}.')
